# Spotify-Playlist-Beatsaver-Map-Downloader-File
Finds and downloads Beat Saber maps from a Spotify playlist         
(it's not perfect; may miss a few songs since it doesn't look through every map)

# Setup
To start, the program will need to authenticate your Spotify
account. To do so, it will open a Chrome tab where you
will have to sign into Spotify and accept the terms.
Then, paste url of the page that it opens (should be my
Twitter account) into the command prompt where prompted.

# Playlist ID
This program will ask for a spotify playlist id.
To get the playlist id for the playlist you want to use,
open your playlist in spotify, click the three dots ('more'),
hover over 'Share', and click 'Copy link to playlist'.
Paste the link to the playlist somewhere, which should look like this:
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO0ENBD2?si=7121c73dcac14316
Copy the ID between 'playlist/' and '?'. In this example, the
playlist id is '37i9dQZF1DZ06evO0ENBD2'

# Custom Maps Folder Path
The custom map file path should look like                       
Steam: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels              
Oculus: C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels
